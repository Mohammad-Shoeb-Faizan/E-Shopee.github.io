# E-Shopee

E-Shopee is an e-commerce website developed as part of my internship process at internPe. The project aims to provide a practical learning experience in web development and showcase my skills in building a functional e-commerce platform.

## Internship Process at internPe

I am currently undertaking an internship at internPe, a renowned company in the Tech industry. This internship offers me a valuable opportunity to gain real-world experience and apply my knowledge in a professional setting. Throughout the internship, I will be working closely with a team of experienced developers and mentors who will guide me through various projects and tasks.

As my first task at internPe, I have been assigned to develop the E-Shopee website. This project will allow me to enhance my web development skills and gain hands-on experience in building a full-fledged e-commerce platform. I am excited to learn from industry experts and contribute to the growth of internPe.

## Project Overview

The E-Shopee website is designed to provide users with an intuitive and seamless online shopping experience. It offers a wide range of features and functionalities to facilitate product browsing, selection, and purchase. Some of the key features include:

- **Product Catalog**: Users can explore a diverse range of products across multiple categories.
- **Product Search**: Users can easily search for specific products using keywords.
- **Product Details**: Detailed information about each product, including descriptions, pricing, and customer reviews.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, review the cart contents, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Placement**: Secure and convenient order placement with options for shipping and payment.
- **Blog**: A dedicated blog section where users can read articles about products, industry trends, and tips.

The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It leverages Font Awesome for scalable icons and follows best practices in web development to ensure a robust and user-friendly website.
